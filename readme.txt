This plugin allows you to reference all media content from your live site.

== Description ==

_This is a Wordpress plugin built for development & staging sites._

---

**What does it do?**

Staging CDN works similar to a CDN but instead of referencing a CDN it references all media from an existing production site.  
The plugin is very lightweight and only rewrites the src url if the files does not exist locally

---

**Who is it for? What is its purpose?**

The plugin was built for developers to speed up their workflow so they can spend more time developing and less time keeping their environments in  snyc.
