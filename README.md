# Staging-CDN

<i>This is a Wordpress plugin built for development & staging sites.</i>

<hr />

<strong> What does it do? </strong>

<p>Staging CDN works similar to a CDN but instead of referencing a CDN it references all media from an existing production site.</p>
<p>The plugin is very lightweight and only rewrites the src url if the files does not exist locally</p>

<hr/>

<strong>Who is it for? What is its purpose?</strong>

<p>The plugin was built for developers to speed up their workflow so they can spend more time developing and less time keeping their environments in  snyc.</p>
